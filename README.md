# Phing Buildtools for the SilverStripe Project

## Overview

The goal of this project is to aid SilverStripe developers in automating various aspects of their build
through [phing](http://phing.info).

It is primarily geared towards core developers preparing a SilverStripe release, 
but can also be a starting point for custom build setups.

Notable features:

 * Creating and uploading release archives
 * Multi-module tagging and checkout of tags and branches
 * Multi-module changelogs with automatic sorting by "commit tags"
 * Translation workflow around [getlocalization.com](http://getlocalization.com/) (see [docs](http://doc.silverstripe.org/framework/en/trunk/misc/translation-process)) (SilverStripe 3.x only)

The phing targets are generally compatible with SilverStripe 2.4 and newer.

## Installation

First of all, get started with phing:

	pear channel-discover pear.phing.info
	pear install phing/phing
	pear install pear/VersionControl_Git-0.4.4

Then install the project via [composer](http://getcomposer.org).

	composer require silverstripe/buildtools



## Usage

Run `phing -l` to see a full list of available targets,
and `phing help` for in-depth help.
